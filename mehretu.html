            A proposal and maquette for a public spacial intervention that pays hommage to the work of painter, Julie
            Mheretu. We draw from Mheretu’s recurrent conceptual themes of nationalism, immigration and social
            inequality, by intervening in a traffic-heavy corridor, forcing navigation and contemplation of ideas and
            questions surrounding complex issues of globalization that are relevant to the space itself.

        <p>
            We explicitly draw upon Mheretu’s aesthetic themes of layering, perspective and scale by incorporating a
            series transparent panels down a long corridor that cause overlapping between abstracted images as commuters
            move through the space. By presenting contrasting images of international travel and immigration in a
            corridor on the semi-public property of the International Civil Aviation Organization, a branch of the UN,
            we raise questions about inequality and the complexity of a ‘global village.’

            A peer, Asa Perlman and myself collaborated on all conceptual aspects, while I contributed the image work,
            documentation and communication of the project. This was great practice in 3 dimensional design that
            involved the consideration of public space, the challenges and limitations involved with this type of
            installation work.<br />
