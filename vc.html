            <p> My name is Maya Jain. I am a multi-disciplinary designer. I strive to <span class="bold">prioritize care</span> in a world governed by profit. Through design, I hope to <span class="bold">empower</span> in ways that grant individuals, and communities <span class="bold">the freedom to thrive and cultivate joy</span>. Iâ€™d like to think that my work exists at the intersection of an active, politically engaged practice and an artistic, philosophical, creative one. My background is in a variety of media that range from <span class="bold">agriculture and food </span> to <span class="bold">fashion design.</span></p>

            <h1> VALUE COLLECTIVE </h1>
            <p> 2021-ongoing </p>

            <p>  
            Broadly, Value Collective is a support structure for intrinsically motivated people to develop non-financial economic projects and ideas.<span class="bold"> Value Collective addresses financialization as a system that inhibits our ability to undertake projects with important social, economic or environmental impacts because financial return is not their primary driver.</span> And, the financialization and commodification of housing specifically is recognized here as one of the central barriers to undertaking value-driven work. <br> 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="info2">
        <p> The project will take the form of a living lab with several overlapping components. First, Value Collective will provide rent-free living and workspace for a rotating cohort of self-organized residents whose work is not financially profitable but does generate valuable outcomes. The institution will provide real assets rather than financial compensation to meet needs such as space, food, tools, resources and networks. While directly supporting residents, Value Collective will also record, prototype, and research outcomes of its alter-economic model. This structure will function like an incubator, only rather than incubating businesses, Value Collective will incubate relationships, motivations, knowledge, new systems of coordination and imaginative possibilities. Longer-term outcomes will hopefully include increasing <span class="bold">collective engagement with alternatives to profit-driven and market-centered systems, in culture and in politics.</span> <br>
