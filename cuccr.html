            For one year, I worked as the Communications Intern for the Concordia University Centre for Creative Reuse.
            This is an organization the diverts materials from the Universityâ€™s waste stream and makes them available to
            the public for free along with opportunities for skill sharing, building tool literacy, and encouraged
            repair and reuse. Ultimately they are facilitating a culture of reuse amongst an engaged and diverse
            community.

            I helped them visually communicate their re-opening, expansion and other events, created maps posted across
            the campus and aided in the process of creating new way-finding.

                >This was not only valuable experience in communications, but also in my learning about active systemic
                change and the development of socially and environmentally sustainable initiatives.</span
            >
            I took part in compelling discussions about community empowerment, inclusivity and accessibility,
            institutional change, as well as witnessed the development of a resilient community aimed at sustainable
            change.<br />

            My work varied greatly and included illustration, typography, video, photography, animation, poster design,
            way-finding, social media page management and strategizing for the communication of new missions and
            mandate.
